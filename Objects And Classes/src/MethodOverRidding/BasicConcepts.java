package MethodOverRidding;
//if subclass(child class)has the name method as declared in the parent class,it is known as method overriding 
//in other words if a subclass provides the specific implementation of the method that has been declared by it's parent class,
//it;s known as method overriding
//Usage of java Method Overriding
//1..Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by it's
//superclass
//1..Method overriding is used for run time polymorphism
//Rules for java Overriding
//1..The emthod must have the same name as in the parent class
//2..the method must have the same parameter as the parent class
//3.. there must be an IS-A relationship(Inheritance)
//We cannot override static method,it can be proved by runtime polymorphism
//why can't we override static method
//...it's because the static method is bound with class ,where as instance method is bound with an object.
//Static belongs to the class area,and instance belongs to the heap area
//can we override main method..no we can't ,because it's static method
