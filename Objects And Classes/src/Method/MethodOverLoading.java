package Method;
//id a class has multiple methods having same name but different in parameters,it's known as Method Overloading
//if we have to perform only one operation,having same name of the methods increases the readability of the program.
//Suppose you have to perform addition of the given numbers but there can be any numbers arguments,if you write the method
//such as a(int,int) for two parameters,the b(int,int,int)for three parameters,then it may be difficult for you as well as other
//programmers to understand the behaviour of the method because it's name differs.
// so we can use method overloading to figure out programs quickly
//there are two ways to overload the method in java
//1.By changing number of arguments
//2.By changing the data type
