//In this page we will learn about Java objects and classes>in object-oriented programming technique,
//we design a program using objects and classes
//An object in Java is the physical as well as alogical entity,whereas,a class in Java is a logical entity only
//What's an object in Java Pencil,Apple,Book Bag,Board
//An entity that has state and behaviour is known as an object object e.g chair,bike,marker,pen,table,car,etc.
//It can be physical or logial (tangible and intangible).The example of an intangible object is the banking system


//An object has three characterstics:
//..State:represents the data(value)of an object
//..Behavior:represents the behavior(functionality) of an object such as deposit,withdraw,etc.
//..Identity:An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID.The value of the ID is 
//..not visible to the external user.However,it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely
//For Example,Pen is an object.Its name is Reynolds;color is white,known as its sate.
//It is used to write,so writing is it behavior.

//An object is an instance of a class.A class is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
//So an object is an instance(result) of a class.

//Object Definitions:
//..An object is a real-world entity
//..An object is a run time entity
//..The object is an entity which has state and behavior.
//..The object is an instance of a class

//What is a class in java
//A class is a group of objects which have common properties,It's a template or blueprint from which objects
//are created.It is a logical entity.It can't be physical.

// A class in Java can contain:
//..Fields,Methods,Constructors,Books,Nested class and interface

//Instance variable in java
//A variable which is created inside the class but outside the method is known as an instance variable.
//Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time.It gets memory at runtime when an object 
//or instance is created.Tha is why it is known as an instance variable

//Method in Java
//In Java,a method is like a function which is used to expose the behavior of an object.
//Advantages of Method
//..code Reusability
//..Code optimization


//New Keyword in Java
//..The new keyword is used to allocate memory at runtime.All objects get memory in Heap memory area


//What are the different ways to create an object in Java
//1.By new keyword,2.By newInstance()method,3.By clones()method,4.By deserialization,5.By factory method
