package JavaFinallyBlock;
//Java Finally block is a block that is used to execute important code such as closing connection,stream etc.
//java finally block is always executed whether exception is handled or not.
//Java finally block follows try or catch block
//Program code-->exception occurred--> yes--> exception handled--> yes-->finally block is executed
//exception occurred-->no-->finally block is executed

//Note:-if we don't handle exception,before terminating the program,JVM executes finally block(if any)

//Why use java finally
//Finally block in java can be used to put "cleanup" code such as closing a file,closing connection etc.
