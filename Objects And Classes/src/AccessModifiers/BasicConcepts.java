package AccessModifiers;
//Ther are two types of modifiers in java;access modifiers and non-access modifiers
//The acces modifier in java specifies the accessibility or the scope of a field,method,constructor,or class.We can
//change the access level of fields,constructors,methods,and class by applying the access modifiers on it.


//There are four types of java access modifiers
//1.private;The access level of a private modifier is only within the class.It cannot be accessed from the class
//2.Default:The access level of a default modifier is only with in the package.It cannot be accessed from outside
//the package.If we don't specifyany access level,it will be the default.
//3.Protected:The access level of a protected modifier is within the package and outside the package through child class
//If we don't make the child class,it can't be accessed from outside the package.
//Public:The access level of a public modifier is everywhere.It can be accessed from wthin the class,outside
//the class,within the package and outside the package

//Ther are many non-access modifiers,such as static,abstract,synchronized,native,volatile,transient etc.here
