package JavaCatchMultipleExceptions;
//A try can be followed by one or more catch blocks.Each catch block must contain a different exception handler.
//So,if you have to perform different tasks at the occurrence of different exceptions,use java multi-catch block

//Points to remember
//..At a time only one exception occurs and at a time only one catch block is executed
//..All catch blocks must be ordered from most specific to most general,i.e catch for ArithmeticException must come before 
//catch for Exception
