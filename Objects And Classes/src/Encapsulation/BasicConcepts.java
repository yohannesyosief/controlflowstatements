package Encapsulation;
//Encapsulation in java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.
//for example,a capsule which is mixed of several medicines
//We can create a fully encapsulated class in java by making all the data members of the class private.Now
//we can use setter and getter methods to set AND GET THE DATA IN IT.
//Now we can use setter and getter methods to set and get the data in it.


//Advantages of encapsulation in java
//By providing only setter and getter method,you can make the class read-only or write-only.In other
//words,you can skip the getter or setter methods.
//it provides us the control over the data.Suppose we want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only
//you can write the logic inside the setter method.You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers
//in the setter methods.

//It;s a way to achieve data hiding in java because other class will not be able to access the data through
//the private data method

//the encapsulate class is eaasy to test.So,it's better for unit testing.

//The standard IDE's are providing the facility to generate the getters and setters.So,it is 
//easy and fast to create an encapsulated class in java


//Getters and setters are used to protect your data,particularly when creating classes.For each instance
//variable,a getter method returns its value...The getter method returns the value of the attribute.
//The setter method takes a parameter and assigns it to the attribute.
