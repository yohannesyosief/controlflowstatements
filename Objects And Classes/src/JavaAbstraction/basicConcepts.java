package JavaAbstraction;
//A class which is declared with the abstract keyword is known as an abstract class in java.
//It can have abstract and non-abstract methods(method with the body)
//before learning the java abstract class ,let's understand the abstraction in java first
//Abstraction in java;abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only
//functionality to the user
//Another way,it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details,for example,
//Sending SMS where you type the text and send the message.You don't know the internal processing about the
//message delivery
//Ways to achieve Abstraction
//There are two ways to achieve abstraction in java
//1..Abstract class(0 to 100%)
//2.interface(100%)
//Abstract class in java
//A class which is declared as abstract is known as an abstract class.It can have and non-abstract methods.
//It needs to be extended and its method implemented.It cannot be instantiated
//Points to 
//1..An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword
//2..It can have abstract and non-abstract methods
//3.. It cannot be instantiated
//4..It can have constructors and static methods also
//5..It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body the ,
//Abstract Method in java
//..A method which is declared as abstract and doesn't have implementation is know as an abstract method
//Example..abstract void printStatus();//no method and abstract
