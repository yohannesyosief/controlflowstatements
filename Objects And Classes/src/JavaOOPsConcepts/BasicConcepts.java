//In this page,we will learn about the basics of OOPs.Object-Oriented Programming is a paradigm that provides many concepts,
//such as inheritance,data binding,polymotphism.
//Simula is considered the first object-oriented programming language.The programming paradigm where everything is represented as an
//object is known as a truly object-oriented programming language

//Smalltalk is considered the first truly object-oriented programming language

//The popular object-oriented languages are Java,C#,PHP,Phyton,C++.etc

//The main aim of object-oriented programming is to implement real-world entities.for example,object,
//classes,abstraction,inheritance,polymorphism


//OOPs(Object-Oriented Programming System)
//Object means a real world entity such as apen,chair,table,computer,watch,etc.Object-oriented
//Programming is a methodology or paradigm is a methodology or paradigm to design a program using classes and objects.It simplifies
//softwaremdevelopment and maintenance by providing some concepts:
//Object,Class,Inheritance,polymorphism,Abstraction,Encapsulation

//Apart from these concepts,there are some other terms which are used in Object-Oriented design:
//Coupling,Cohesion,Association,Composition

//Object
//Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object,for Example, a chair,pen,able,keyboard,bike,etc.
//It can be physical or logical

//an Object can be defined as an instance of a class.An object contain an address and takes up some space in memory.
//Object can communicate without knowing the details of each other's data or code.
//The only necessery thing is the type of message accepted and the type of response returned by the objects

//Example: a dog is an object because it has states like color,name,bread,etc.As well as behavior like wagging the tail,barking,eating etc


//Class
//Collection of objects is called class.It is a logical entity.
//A class can also be defined as a blueprint from which you can create an individual object.Class doesn't consume ant space.

//Inheritance
//When an object acquires all the properties and behavior of a parent object,it is known as inheritance.It provides code reusability.
//It provides code reusability.It is used to achieve polymotphism
//For eg. Now speak says one person...a duck says "Quack",..a Dog says "Woof",..A cat says "Meow"

//Polymorphism
//If one task is performed in different ways.it is known as polymorhism.For example:to convince the customer differently,
//to draw something,for example to achieve polymorphism

//In Java,we use method overloading and method oerriding to achieve polymorphism.

//Another example can be to speak something;for example,a cat speaks meow,dog barks woof,etc.

//Abstraction
//Hiding internal details and showing funtionality is known as abstraction.for example phone call,we don;t know the internal processing

//in Java,we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.

//Capsul
//Encapsulation
//Binding(or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are known as encapsualtion.For example,a capsule,
//it is wrapped with different medicines.

//A java class is the example of encapsualtion.java bean is the fully encapsulated class because all the data members are private here.


//Coupling
//Coupling refers to the knowledge or information or dependency of another class.it raises when classes are aware of each other
//If a class has the details information of another class,there is strong coupling.In Java,we use private,proetected,and public modifiers
//to display the visibility level of a class,method,and field.You can use interfaces for the weaker coupling because 
//there is no concrete implementation


//Cohesion
//Cohesion refers to the level of a component which performs a single well-defined task.A single well-defiend task is done by a highly
//cohesive method.The weakly cohesive method will split the task into separate parts.The java.io package is a highly cohesive package 
//because it has I/o related classes and interface.However,the java.util package is a weakly cohesive package because it has unrelated
//classes and interfaces

//Association
//Association represents the relationship between the objects.here,one object can be associated with one object or many objects.
//There can be four types of association between the objects:
//One tone,..One to Many,..Many to One,and..Many to Many
//Let's understand the relationship with real-time examples.For example,One country can hav one prime minister(one to one),and a prime minister
//can have many ministers(one to many).Also,many MP's can have one prime minister(many to one),and many ministers can
//have many departments (many to many)
//Association can be undirectional or bidirectional

//Aggregation
//aggregation is a way to achieve Association.Aggregation represents represents the relationship where one object contains other 
//objects as apart of its state.It represents the weak relationship between objects.It is also termed as a has-a relationship in java.Like,
//inheritance represents the is-a relationship,It is another way to reuse objects.

//Composition
//the composition is also a way to achieve association.The composition represents the relationship where one object 
//contains other objectss as part of it state.there is a strong relation between the containig object and the dependent object.It is the state
//where containing objects do not have an independent existence.If you delete the parent object,all the child objects will be deleted automatically


//Advantage of OOPs over Procedure-oriented programming language
//1)OOps makes development and maintenance easier,whereas,in a procedure-oriented programming language,it is not easy to manage 
//if code grows as protected size increases

//2)OOPs provides data hiding,where,in a procedure-oriented programming language,global data can be accessed from anywhere
//Globaldata(fun1(),fun2(),fun3())..figure:Data representation in procedue-Oriented programming
//Object data(fun1(),fun2()),Object data(fun1(),fun2())..Figure:Data Representation in object-Oriented programming

//3)OOps provides the ability to stimulate real-world event much more effectively.We can provide the solution of real word
//problem if we are using the Object-oriented programming language.

//What is the difference between an object-oriented programming language and object based programming language

//Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOps except inheritance.JavaScript and VBScript are examples of
//object-based programming languages.

//Do You Know?
//1..can we overload the main method?
//2.A Java constructor returns a value but,what?
//3. Can we create a program without main Method?
//.What are the six ways to use this keyword?
//Why is multiple inheritance not supported in Java?
//Why use agregation?
//Can we override the static method?
//What is covariant return type?
//What are the usage of java super keywrod?
//Why use instance initializer block?
//What is the usage of a blank final variable?
//What is a marker or tagged interface?
//What is runtime polymorphism or dynamic method dispatch?
//What is the difference between static and dynamic binding?
//What is he difference between static and dynamic binding?
//How downcasting is possible in Java?
//What is the purpose of a private constructor?
//What is object cloning?

//What we will learn in OOPs Concepts?

//Naming Convention
//Object and class
//Method overloading
//Constructor
//Static keyword
//Tis keyword with six usage
