package Arrays;
//Normally an array is acollection of similar type of elements which has contiguous memeory location.
//Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type.Additionaly the elements of an array
//are stored in a contiguous memory location.It is a data structure where we store similar elements.
//We can store only a fixed set of elements in a java array
//Array in java is index-based,the first element of the array is stored at the 0th index,
//2nd element is stored in the 1st index and so on
//Unlike C/C++,we can get the length of the aray using the length memeber.In C/C++,we need to use 
//the size of the operator



//In java,array is an object of a dynamically generated class.Java array inherits the object class,and implements
//the Serialzable as well as Cloneable interface.We can store primitive values or objects in an array in java.
//Like C/C++,we can also create single dimensional or multimentional arrays in java
//More over java provides the feature of anonymous arrays which is not available in C/C++


//Advantages
//.Code Optimization :it makes the code optimized,we can retrieve or sort the data efficiently
//Random access:We can get any data located at an index position

//Disadvantages
//.Size Limit:We can store only the fixed size of elements in the array.It doesn't grow its size at runtime.
//To solve this problem,collection framework is used in java which grows automatically


//Types of array in java
//There are two types of array
//..Single Dimensional Array
//..Multidimensional Array

//Single Dimensional Array in java
//syntax to declare an Array in java
//dataType[] arr,or
//dataType[]arr;or
//dataTypearr[];
//Instatiation of an array
//arrayRefVar=new datatype[size];
