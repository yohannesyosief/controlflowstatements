package Interface;
//An interface in java is a blueprint of a class.it has static constant and abstract method
//The interface in java is the mechanism to achieve abstraction.There can be only abstract methods in the java interface
//not the method body.it's used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in java
//In other words,we can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables.it cannot have a method body
//Java interface also represents the IS-A relationship
//It can't be instantiated like the abstract class
//Since Java 8,we have default and static methods in an interface
//Since java 9,we can have private methods in an interface
//Why use Java interface?
//...It's used below to achieve abstraction
//... By interface,we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance
//...It can be used to achieve loose coupling
//How to declare interface
//An interface is declared by using the interface keyword.It provides total abstraction,means all the 
//methods in an interface are declared with empty body,and all the fields are public,static and final by
//default.A class that implements an interface must implement all the methods declared in the interface
//
//Syntax
//interface <interface-name>{
//declare constant fields
//declare methods that abstract
//by default
//}
//internal addition by the compiler
//The java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method.Moreover,it adds public,
//static and final keywords before data members.
//In other words,interface fields are public ,static and final by default,and methods are republic and 
//The relationship between classes and interface
//..a class extends another another class,an interface extends another interface,but a class implements an interface
